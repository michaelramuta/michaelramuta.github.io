      <h1>Pairing and Feedback</h1>

        I've been pretty heavily exposed to peer pairing in the last few weeks, with at least 2 pairing sessions per week. I thought it was really fun to be able to bounce ideas off someone else, and work as a team to solve problems. It comes in handy when we hit a wall and are able to vocalize what we think could work to solve the problem. I'm excited to move onto more challenging exercises, as all have so far taken less than an hour. Nothing has been particularly frustrating, other than sometimes a partner arriving not prepared for the exercises. Bring on some more pairing!

        I've also received feedback from my peer pairing sessions over the last few weeks. It was rewarding reading my feedback from these sessions, as it has largely been positive. It is nice to remind myself that I'm on top of my work and am comfortable peering with others. I also received some notes on my pseudocode and occassional sloppiness, which I totally agree with! It will help me dedicate more time to working on those errors. I will be working on these aspects next time I pair.

        Writing feedback wasn't too difficult. Sometimes, I felt like I didn't have much to say, because it was such a smooth overall experience, so I hope that my briefness can be understood.

        Overall, peer pairing seems like a great way to problem solve, and I'm excited to do more over the upcoming weeks!
