        <h4>June 4, 2015</h4>
        <p>I've just revamped my website! I think it's looking a lot better (I think it's fair to say that it no longer looks like at a first attempt to build a website).</p>
        <p>
          Most of the advice I was given was about adjusting the color scheme, and building it so the buttons to other pages were better organized. It wasn't a terribly difficult process to change everything, but it took a bit of time to test and experiment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The biggest issue that I had was getting columns to align on the page. I'm sure that this will become a lot easier as I get more experience with website design. While I understand the way that "float" works, sometimes I get confused about what happens when I resize the window. Updating the page has given me quite a bit more practice with that.
        </p>
        <p>
          The one issue that I'd really like to fix once I have the proper skills is to get the left sidebar with "about me", "blog", etc. to extend to go as far down the page as the text area to it's side. I suppose maybe I could put both in a div itself? I'm not sure. I'll think about it for a while! Please shoot me an email if you have any ideas for how to make my website better!
