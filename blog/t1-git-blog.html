      <h1>Learning Version Control, Git Tracking Changes, and GitHub</h1>

      I have been learning a lot about version control over the last few days, and it is a very useful tool when writing code. Essentially, when making a change to existing code, a new version of it is saved, so that at any time, there is a version that still works correctly (the master version) and you can go back to any previous version of the code. If the code somehow becomes unusable, you can always go back to the master version, which will work correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to keep the different versions organized, a version control system is used. I have been using git, which stores all my current and previous versions. Every time I make a change to my code, I can "commit" the change, which lets me write exactly what the change is. I can then go back at any time and access old versions.
    </p>
    <p>
        After I commit a change to my computer, it is still local and can't be accessed by anyone else. In order to distribute my code and let others modify or improve it, I can push the code onto the internet. I am currently using GitHub, which hosts and distributes my code. This way, I can work with programmers around the world to develop better code.
