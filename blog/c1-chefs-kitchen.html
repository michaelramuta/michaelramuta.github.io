      I'm nearing the end of my first week of Dev Bootcamp and I'm feeling really good about it. I'm really lucky to have already had experience working a desk job for a few years before this, because (possibly unlike in college) I am keen to get the most out of my education and really make it count. I have a work ethic in me that I certainly didn't have as a high school or college student, so I'm very excited to learn new skills that can translate to a career in computer science.

        I'm really enjoying the Dev Bootcamp experience so far. The challenges that I've worked on have been small enough to be digestable, but big enough that I've felt accomplished upon completion. If the rest of the challenges continue to build on each other like this, I feel confident that I'll be able to work hard and keep myself interested in this course.

        There are certainly some things about Dev Bootcamp that are a little outside my comfort zone. I'm not feeling great about my ability to write technically yet, so I'm going to feel much happier with more experience of that under my belt. I also felt a little weird about some of the videos I've watched on the philosophy of Dev Bootcamp. I'm not quite familiar with the concepts of mildfulness or meditation, and feel that my learning habits are already suited well enough for a course like this, but I'm going to keep an open mind and give these philosophies my best.

      Even though I'm not feeling completely in my comfort zone, I think that is a good thing. I want to feel challenged and busy, and I'm hoping I can get the most I can out of this course. In a video I watched earlier on the philosophies of Dev Bootcamp, it was explained that I could either be in the kitchen (to produce and develop) or at the table (to consume). I want to work and be engaged, so I think I belong in the kitchen.
