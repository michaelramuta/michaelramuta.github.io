        <h1>Affirmation and Stereotype Threat</h1>
        <h4>May 22, 2015</h4>
        <p>
        The values that are most important to me are: accomplishment, close relationships, adventure, challenge, confidence, independence, and music. I try to live up to these values as much as I can (although sometimes I think it's fair to say that I leave music by the wayside). Other than that though, I try my best to exude these traits/values consistently throughout my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adventure is a very important value to me. I'm so lucky that I have the opportunities and means to try new and exciting things in my life (in both career, travel, and personal life) rather than just settle into a regular routine. I was able to move across the country for a job a few years ago, and now I'm lucky that I'm able to take a challenge and a move myself back. I'm currently in Houston, TX as I write this: a city and state that I've never even thought of visiting... but here I am! It's so great to try new things.

        The last time someone asked me for advice (and probably the last several times people did), it was where to move to. This ties in pretty closely to my value of adventure, as without that, it is really difficult to get up and mvoe to a new place, and try new things. I'm happy that my friends can approach me to talk about this, because it's something I'm really passionate about.
      </p>

        I think the biggest help I can have to combat stereotype threat if I recognize it is my confidence. I try my best to always come at problems/challenges assuming that there is a way for me to overcome it. Whenever I'm feeling that stereotype threat may be upon me, I can always remind myself to be confident, and that alone can give me the courage to succeed.
