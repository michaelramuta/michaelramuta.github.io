      <h1>Conflict</h1>

        Let's talk about a conflict I've faced in my life. I once had a roommate in college who wasn't good at respecting my personal space. He was prone to opening my bedroom door without knocking, or failing to ask permission when he wanted to throw a party.
      </p>
      <p>
        The source of the conflict was that I felt disrespected by my roommate, who thought that the entire apartment was free for whoever wanted it. I felt disrespected and my privacy felt violated.
      </p>
      <p>
        To solve this conflict, I approached my roommate and let him know how he felt. He immediately apologized and agreed that he would be much better at respecting my space. This was very successful, and we had no further problems for the rest of the year.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I could change anything, I would have told him sooner that I had this problem, so it could have been solved faster. From this, I learned how important communication can be when I'm feeling disrespected, and how people will usually immediately apologize and seek to make things right.
