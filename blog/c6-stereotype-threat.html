        <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
        <h4>May 16, 2015</h4>
        <p>
        I've been reading about Stereotype Threat for my blog post this week. Stereotype Threat is when people are aware of negative stereotypes, and as a result of being afraid of conforming to the stereotypes, perform worse on tasks due to anxiety. This is an unfortunate psychological response, but luckily it seems like it can be corrected for. For example, simply being aware of Stereotype Threat may help reduce it's effects.

        Personally, I don't believe that I have experienced Stereotype Threat. I can still absolutely imagine what it feels like. If I feel like I'm destined for fail, or even if I feel that the consequences of failing a task are going to be significant, anxiety will increase and there's a much bigger chance for me to do worse.
      </p>

        From reading about the phenomenon, the best way to stop Stereotype Threat is to provide a more welcoming environment and address it to aleviate any potential issues. Education may simply be the key to stopping it!
