        <h1>Problems in Technology: Women and Programming</h1>
        <h4>May 1, 2015</h4>
        <p>
        It's no secret that women are severely under represented in many of the STEM fields, and the fields obviously suffer for it. According to NPR (<a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/04/29/178810467/blazing-the-trail-for-female-programmers">Source</a>) only 20% of programmers are female.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a problem, not only because it excludes women from a growing (and high paying) section of the workforce, but also because teams will strongly benefit from having more diverse members.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a few potential strategies for increasing the role of women in programming:
        <br>
        <ol><li>Provide scholarships to women interested in programming.</li>
          <li>Promote societies and groups designed to provide support for women in programming.</li>
          <li>Get young women interested in programming from an early age, by reaching out to middle and high school students.</li>
          <li>Educate businesses on the benefits of increasing diversity and providing opportunities for women.</li>
        </ol>
