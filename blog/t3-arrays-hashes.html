      <h1>Arrays and Hashes</h1>

            This week, I've been learning a lot about the programming language Ruby. As part of this, I've learned the difference between arrays and hashes. Follow along to see what's the deal!
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to use Ruby to it's full potential, you need to invoke the concepts of arrays or hashes. An array is simply a set of objects. We put an array in brackets, separated by commas. They look like this
      </p>
        <code> array1 = [object1, object2, object3]</code>
<p>
        We can call any object out of an array by simply calling the method <code>array.[position]</code> where position is the position of the object (starting at zero). For example, if we wanted to call the second object, we would use the code <code>array.[1]</code> which would return <code>object2</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        These arrays can be manipulated and transformed, but the idea is that an array is a set of ordered objects. Objects can even be arrays themselves! They can also be empty arrays such as <code>array = []</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        A hash is similar to an array, but a hash consists of ordered pairs, rather than just ordered objects. Each pair in a hash consists of a key and a value. We can use them like a set of coordinates, and (like an array) they are in a set order, that can be rearranged at will. Here is an example of a hash:
      </p>
      <p>
        <code> hash1 = { "a" => 1, "b" => 2, "c" => 3}</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        With a hash like this, we can call on one of the keys, and result in a value, such as if we call <code>hash1["a"]</code> we will return <code>1</code> and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        A hash is similar to an array, but instead of calling on an integer to determine what the value of an object in the array is, we call on a specific value to determine the value of an object in the hash.
      </p>
      <p>
        So far, I've largely been using arrays in my programs that I've been producing, but I'm excited to begin using hashes as well to solve new problems!
