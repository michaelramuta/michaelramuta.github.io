        <h1>Asking Questions</h1>
        <h4>6/7/2015</h4>
        <p>What makes a good question? So far, in this class, a better translation would be: what makes a good google search? But for the on campus portion, I'll need to be able to ask good questions.</p>
        <p>
          It is first helpful to make sure that I have a clear idea of what I want to know. If I'm not sure what the question is, no one will be able to answer me! So first, I just give myself a few seconds to make sure I know what information I'm looking for (but even if I'm lost, I can just be clear about that as well!)
        </p>
        <p>
          A good question is as succinct and clear as possible. Unnecessary information can confuse the person you're talking to and take them down the wrong path. If you need to show an example or some code, have it already queued up so they won't have to watch you scroll through your keyboard for hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          But you also need to be sure that you give the person the information they need to help you out. Be sure to explain which language you're using and other necessary points in your question.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other than that, I'd just recommend doing your best to google answers ahead of time, and being fearless when talking to others. We're all human, and many of us are willing (and excited) to answer questions when we know the answer. Just ask!
