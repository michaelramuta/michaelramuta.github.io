        <h1>Phase 0 Recap (so far!)</h1>
        <h4>April 24, 2015</h4>
        <p>
        So far (about three weeks), I've been feeling very comfortable with what I've learned at DevBootcamp. I was initially worried that the class would be moving way too fast for me, but I'm feeling completely confident in what I've learned so far. I've touched base with working with the terminal, CSS, HTML, and Ruby, and I feel excited to continue my learning. My guided pairing sessions have only increased my confidence, and I can't wait to build upon my knowledge and become a better programmer.

        The biggest struggle I've faced is having trouble staying focused for the reading sections. Chris Pine's "Learn To Program" has been fantastic, and has really kept my interest up (honestly, it's a more enjoyable read than the book I'm reading about improv comedy). But the sections I've been reading from "The Well Grounded Rubyist" have been incredibly boring. I really don't like the way they are written, and I find myself skimming very frequently, due to both to my existing knowledge of concepts, and the dull way the book is written. I will probably find myself going back to that book for reference, but I am finding it very difficult to read.

        I suppose that the best way to deal with the boring readings is to just set aside a significant amount of time to deal with it and power through. I don't think this is related to my learning style, it is just a result of a poorly written book. But if we were to put the blame on myself, I guess it would be a result of me having a lower attention span for reading. If I'm solving problems and getting in the muck, I feel a lot more confident and excited.
      </p>
      <p>
        To expand my learning styles and really continue my education with a "growth mindset", I'm going to work on getting better at increasing my reading comprehension and interest. I think this can be done by really devoting the proper time to sitting down and reading this (dull, in my opinion) book. I made it through countless terribly boring classes in college, I'm sure I can put in the brain power to get this book to stick in my brain.
